# Operating-System-Algorithms-and-Problems

Welcome to the Operating System Algorithms and Problems Repository! This repository contains various programs implemented using different algorithmic techniques, including process scheduling algorithms, disk scheduling algorithms, page replacement algorithms, etc. The programs are implemented in C++ programming languages.

## Algorithms Implemented

The repository contains implementations of the following algorithms:

1. Process Scheduling Algorithms:
   - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
   - SJF (Scheduling Job First)
   - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
   - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
   - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
   - Round Robbin

2. Disk Scheduling:
   - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
   - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
   - SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
   - C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
   - LOOK
   - C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)

3. Page Replacement Algorithms:
   - LRU (Least Recently Used)
   - OPTIMAL
   - FIFO (First In First Out)

4. Banker's Algorithm
     
6. Sleeping Barber's Problem

7. Interprocess Communication using PIPE
